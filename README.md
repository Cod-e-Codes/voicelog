## Technical Details

Built with:
- **[Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)** - TUI framework
- **[PortAudio](https://github.com/gordonklaus/portaudio)** - Audio I/O
- **Go** - Programming language

## Known Issues

### Audio Device Problems
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: ALSA errors occur due to missing audio device access. WSL doesn't provide direct access to Windows audio devices.
- **Windows Standalone**: Missing `libportaudio.dll` when running the pre-built binary outside of MSYS2 environment.
- **Recording Issues**: Audio recording may not work properly in some environments, though playback and device detection work correctly.

### Workarounds
- **For WSL**: Use the Windows version instead, as WSL doesn't support direct audio device access.
- **For Windows**: Run from MSYS2 environment or ensure PortAudio libraries are properly installed.
- **For Linux**: Ensure you have proper audio device permissions and ALSA/PulseAudio configured.
